## About

## Requirements

PHP version 5.0.0+, compiled with support for the MySQLi extension will be
needed to run the project. MySQL version 4.1.13 or newer is also needed.

## Installation

Clone this repository and upload the contents of the calendar-v2 folder to your
web root.

Open the includes/config.php file with a text editor of your choice.

Search for `Config::$DB_NAME` and edit this line to change the database name

database details setup. Make sure that these details are correct and the
